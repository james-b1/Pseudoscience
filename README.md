According to John Allen Paulos in his book, _Irrileigion_, Cornelius de Jager was a Dutch astronomer "who concocted the following algorithm for personalized physical constants, [and] used it to advance a charming theory about the metaphysical properties of Dutch bicycles."
The first step is to select any positive real-valued universal physical or mathematical constant that seems interesting to you, e.g., π, e, Planck's constant, the atomic weight of molybdenum, the boiling point of water in Kelvin, whatever you like. Call this constant μ.
Next, select any four positive real numbers not equal to 1 that have personal meaning to you, e.g., your favorite number, day or month or year of birth, age in fortnights or seconds, weight in stones or grams, height in furlongs or millimeters, number of children, house number, apartment number, zip code, last four digits of SSN, whatever you like. Call these four personal numbers w, x, y, and z.
Then, use the de Jager formula (w^a)(x^b)(y^c)(z^d), where each of a, b, c, and d is one of the 17 numbers {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, -1/2, -1/3, -1/4, 0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
This theory asserts that the de Jager formula with your four personal numbers can be used to approximate μ within a fraction of 1% relative error.
This program uses the de Jager formula on user inputed numbers that satisfy the conditions and determines if the theory stands or not.
